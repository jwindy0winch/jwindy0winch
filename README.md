- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jwindy0winch
  I am currently studying at Davenport University for Cyber Defense. My estimated completion date is the Spring of 2025.
  I am looking at transferring to Ferris State University soon after to study Information Security and Intelligence with a concentration in Digital Forensics and Penetration Testing.
